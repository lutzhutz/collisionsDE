# collisionsDE

collisionsDE is a R library to simplify the use of the publicly available collision data from the German Federal Statistical Office 

## Installation

You can install the released version of collisionsDE from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

First, you need to install the devtools package. You can do this from CRAN. Invoke R and then type:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Load the devtools package.

``` r
library("devtools")
```
Now you can download the package with:

``` r
install_github("lutzhutz/collisionsDE")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(collisionsDE)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
